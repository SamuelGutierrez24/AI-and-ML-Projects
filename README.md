# IA --- ML Projects

A portfolio-style collection of personal AI and machine learning projects demonstrating applied skills from coursework and independent study. This repository showcases a variety of experiments and small applications â€” from model training notebooks to agent prototypes and class exercises.

What you'll find here

- Short research agent prototypes (LangChain-based helpers and tools).
- Deep learning experiments (a convolutional model for deepfake image detection with an accompanying report).
- Classic ML experiments (logistic regression and small neural network notebooks showing preprocessing and model comparison).
- Course materials and exercises (prompting and prompt-engineering examples).

Why this repo

This repository is intended as a showcase of practical ML/AI work: reproducible notebooks, concise reports, and small scripts that demonstrate typical tasks (data preprocessing, model training/evaluation, and tool integration with LLMs). It is designed to show what kinds of problems I work on and the techniques I apply.

How to explore

- Browse the folders to find notebooks and readme files for each project. Notebooks are the main artifacts demonstrating experiments and results.
- The `DeepFake Detector CNN Model` folder contains a detailed project report (`ReadMe.md`) describing the architecture, dataset, and outcomes.
- The `Agents` folder contains a compact study of a research-assistant agent and its helper tools.

If you'd like a version of any project prepared for easy reproduction (requirements file, data download helper, or a simple runner script), tell me which project and I will prepare it.
